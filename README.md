### üîç Project Summary: Employee Attrition Prediction

- Developed a machine learning solution to **predict employee attrition** using the IBM HR Analytics dataset.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key features affecting attrition such as:
  - `JobSatisfaction`
  - `MonthlyIncome`
  - `DistanceFromHome`
- Built and evaluated **classification models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Measured model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
- Used **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** to:
  - Explain model predictions globally and locally
  - Visualize feature contributions
- Identified **actionable HR strategies** based on model insights:
  - Increase job satisfaction through engagement programs
  - Offer flexible work arrangements for distant employees
  - Provide clear paths for growth and promotion
- Enabled **data-driven decision-making** for HR teams to proactively reduce employee turnover.
